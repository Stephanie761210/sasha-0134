### 👋 Hi, I'm Sasha.

**Data Scientist | AI Agent Engineer | Entropy Manager**

I spend my days building AI agents and chasing SOTA models that change faster than I can `pip install` them. 

My work is basically 10% coding, 40% reading papers from 2 days ago that made my code obsolete, and 50% wondering if the agent is hallucinating or just creative.

To cope with the velocity of the "AI Era," I design gear for the rest of us. 👇
